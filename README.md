## Introduction To Merkel Tree

A Merkle tree is a data structure with unique properties which make it useful for Bitcoin. Merkle trees are used to store all transactions in a given block. The advantage of this system is that one node can easily prove to another that a given transaction was contained in a specific block. This is useful for SPV nodes and light clients, who do not store the entire blockchain and are only interested in certain transactions or blocks.
